# Simulation of complex particulate systems


The objective of this project is to set up a simulation at different scales of complex particle systems. It is also about showing a mastery of the notions of class, pointer, reference, operators... of C++.
In this project we had to learn how to improve the performance of our code by optimizing the algorithmic choices as well as the choice of structures used.
